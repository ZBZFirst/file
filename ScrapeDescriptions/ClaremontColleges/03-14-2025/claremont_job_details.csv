Job Description:
Position Overview
The primary responsibilities of the Adjunct Faculty member are the instruction and coordination of the Biocon - Fermentation Principles course for the Henry E. Riggs School of Applied Life Sciences. The Biocon-KGI program is a program in partnership with an Indian Biopharmaceutical company which has global presence in the areas of diabetes, cancer and autoimmune diseases.

Candidates will be expected to have a strong commitment to innovative teaching and active learning. The adjunct faculty appointment is on a term-by-term basis and the course is taught via online synchronous live sessions, which take place on weekday evenings (Pacific Standard Time).
Course Description: Students taking this course will study industrial fermentation and how it makes use of the microbial cells and components of cells such as enzymes to manufacture enormous range of commercial products from relatively cheaper materials such as industrial alcohol and organic solvents to expensive specialty chemicals such as antibiotics, therapeutic proteins and vaccines. They will learn how the development and advancement of the fermentation process has led to the manufacture of recombinant DNA derived products such as insulin, human growth hormone and interferon.
Students will gain the knowledge and skills required to turn these products into commercial reality, working with various interdisciplinary scientists and engineers to develop the necessary platforms from genetic manipulation and cell line development to scaling up the process to a pilot scale bioreactor and eventually industrial scale operations. This course will focus on both the fermentation processes and the principles of bioprocessing engineering through a series of lectures, presentations and case studies.
